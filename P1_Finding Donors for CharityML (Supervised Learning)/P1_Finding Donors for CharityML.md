# P1 Finding Donors for CharityML

By Jen-Feng Hsieh

## Getting Started

In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can infer this value from other publically available features. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_ which can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

## Exploring the Data
The last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.

### Implementation: Data Exploration 


```python
# Total number of records
n_records = len(data)

# Number of records where individual's income is more than $50,000
n_greater_50k = data[data['income'] == '>50K']['income'].count()

# Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000
n_at_most_50k = data[data['income'] == '<=50K']['income'].count()

# Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = 100.0 * n_greater_50k / n_records

# Print the results
print("Total number of records: {}".format(n_records))
print("Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k))
print("Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k))
print("Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: {}%".format(greater_percent))
```

## Preparing the Data
Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 


```python
# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)
```


```python
# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
import matplotlib.pyplot as pl

def distribution(data, transformed = False):
    """
    Visualization code for displaying skewed distributions of features
    """
    
    # Create figure
    fig = pl.figure(figsize = (11,5));

    # Skewed feature plotting
    for i, feature in enumerate(['capital-gain','capital-loss']):
        ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, i+1)
        ax.hist(data[feature], bins = 25, color = '#00A0A0')
        ax.set_title("'%s' Feature Distribution"%(feature), fontsize = 14)
        ax.set_xlabel("Value")
        ax.set_ylabel("Number of Records")
        ax.set_ylim((0, 2000))
        ax.set_yticks([0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000])
        ax.set_yticklabels([0, 500, 1000, 1500, ">2000"])

    # Plot aesthetics
    if transformed:
        fig.suptitle("Log-transformed Distributions of Continuous Census Data Features", \
            fontsize = 16, y = 1.03)
    else:
        fig.suptitle("Skewed Distributions of Continuous Census Data Features", \
            fontsize = 16, y = 1.03)

    fig.tight_layout()
    fig.show()


distribution(data)
```

![png](Images/output_11_1.png)


For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.


```python
# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_log_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data = features_raw)
features_log_transformed[skewed] = features_raw[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
distribution(features_log_transformed, transformed = True)
```

      "matplotlib is currently using a non-GUI backend, "



![png](Images/output_13_1.png)


### Normalizing Numerical Features
In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.


```python
# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler() # default=(0, 1)
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']

features_log_minmax_transform = pd.DataFrame(data = features_log_transformed)
features_log_minmax_transform[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_log_transformed[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(features_log_minmax_transform.head(n = 5))
```

### Implementation: Data Preprocessing

From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.

|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |
| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively.


```python
# One-hot encode the 'features_log_minmax_transform' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features_final = pd.get_dummies(features_log_minmax_transform)

# Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.map({'<=50K': 0, '>50K': 1})

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features_final.columns)
print("{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded)))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
# print(encoded)
```

    103 total features after one-hot encoding.


### Shuffle and Split Data
Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.


```python
# Import train_test_split
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
random_state = 0
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_final, 
                                                    income, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2, 
                                                    random_state = random_state)

# Show the results of the split
print("Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0]))
print("Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0]))
```

    Training set has 36177 samples.
    Testing set has 9045 samples.

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of the choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*.

### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:

$$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$

In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).

Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 

### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace
* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset?


```python
'''
TP = np.sum(income) # Counting the ones as this is the naive case. Note that 'income' is the 'income_raw' data 
encoded to numerical values done in the data preprocessing step.
FP = income.count() - TP # Specific to the naive case

TN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
FN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
'''
# Calculate accuracy, precision and recall
accuracy = np.sum(income) / income.count()
recall = np.sum(income) / (np.sum(income) + 0)
precision = np.sum(income) / income.count()

# Calculate F-score using the formula above for beta = 0.5 and correct values for precision and recall.
fscore = (1 + 0.5**2) * (precision * recall) / ((0.5**2) * precision + recall)

# Print the results 
print("Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore))
```

    Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: 0.2478, F-score: 0.2917]


###  Supervised Learning Models
**The following are some of the supervised learning models that are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that we will choose from:**
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

### Question 2 - Model Application
List three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that we will test on the census data. For each model chosen

- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. 
- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?
- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?

**Answer: **

1. Gaussian Naive Bayes
 - Naive Bayes can be used in document classification and spam filtering.
 - The strengths are fast when executing compared to more sophisticated methods and required a small amount of training data. 
 - The weaknesses are it assumes each input variables are independent and cannot understanding phrases which see each word independently.
 - The algorithm can easily to calculate probability results by using many helpful categorial features which are Workclass, Education, Occupation, and Native-country.

2. Logistic Regression
 - Logistic Regression is using a lot in classification problems and the output can be the probability which is easy to set the threshold or to rank the results. 
 - This algorithm is easy to use and can avoid muti-collinearity problems by using L1 or L2 regularizations. 
 - The weaknesses of Logistic regression are it requires large sample sizes and cannot handle large number of categorical features/variables well.
 - Logistic Regression is a classic algorithm which is very easy to use and also can provide features selection by using L2 or L1 regularization

3. Gradient Boosting
 - Gradient Boosting can be applied to classification problems and regression problems, such as fraud detection and credit line prediction.
 - The strength is the algorithm using ensemble and boosting methods to reduce the high variance results comparing to Decision Tree algorithm
 - The weaknesses are this algorithm will increase a little bit of bias than Decision Tree algorithm and ensemble methods take longer time to train the model than other algorithms.
 - Gradient Boosting classifier can show the importance of features which will let us know the main features that effect the results.

### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
To properly evaluate the performance of each model we've chosen, it's important to create a training and predicting pipeline that allows to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data.


```python
# Import two metrics from sklearn - fbeta_score and accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, accuracy_score

def train_predict(learner, sample_size, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test): 
    '''
    inputs:
       - learner: the learning algorithm to be trained and predicted on
       - sample_size: the size of samples (number) to be drawn from training set
       - X_train: features training set
       - y_train: income training set
       - X_test: features testing set
       - y_test: income testing set
    '''
    
    results = {}
    
    # Fit the learner to the training data using slicing with 'sample_size' using .fit(training_features[:], training_labels[:])
    start = time() # Get start time
    learner = learner.fit(X_train[:sample_size], y_train[:sample_size])
    end = time() # Get end time
    
    # Calculate the training time
    results['train_time'] = end - start
        
    # Get the predictions on the test set(X_test),
    # then get predictions on the first 300 training samples(X_train) using .predict()
    start = time() # Get start time
    predictions_test = learner.predict(X_test)
    predictions_train = learner.predict(X_train[:300])
    end = time() # Get end time
    
    # Calculate the total prediction time
    results['pred_time'] = end - start
            
    # Compute accuracy on the first 300 training samples which is y_train[:300]
    results['acc_train'] = accuracy_score(y_train[:300], predictions_train)
        
    # Compute accuracy on test set using accuracy_score()
    results['acc_test'] = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions_test)
    
    # Compute F-score on the the first 300 training samples using fbeta_score()

## Improving Results
In this final section, we will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. We will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model

* Based on the evaluation we performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML* which of the three models that would be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000. 

**Answer: **

The results show Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression have higher accuracy and F1 score than Gaussian Naive Bayes. Gradient Boosting has the highest evaluation scores but it takes much longer time in training and predicting than the others. The reasons that Gaussian Naive Bayes is not performing well because the input variables are not independent of each other and the model cannot fully understand the dataset. Although Logistic Regression has better computation performance and higher evaluation scores, I decide to use Gradient Boosting for further analysis. Gradient Boosting is time-consuming in training and predicting but the model can have lower bias and lower variance results.

### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms

* In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work.

**Answer: ** 

Gradient Boosting is a powerful method that is used in classification and regression problems. In the beginning, the model uses a simple and weak decision tree to learn from training dataset, and then use it to make predictions for validation dataset. Comparing with the actual results, the misclassification records will be obtained, and the model will calculate the error which will be used to update parameters for the weak decision tree. The model will repeat this process many times to improve itself and predict more accurate results than before.

### Implementation: Model Tuning
Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values.


```python
# Import 'GridSearchCV', 'make_scorer', and any other necessary libraries
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, fbeta_score
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Initialize the classifier
clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=random_state)

# Create the parameters list you wish to tune, using a dictionary if needed.
# parameters = {'parameter_1': [value1, value2], 'parameter_2': [value1, value2]}
parameters = {'n_estimators' : [100], 
              'max_depth': [3, 6, 9],
              'min_samples_leaf': [5, 9, 14]}

# Make an fbeta_score scoring object using make_scorer()
scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score, beta=0.5)

# Perform grid search on the classifier using 'scorer' as the scoring method using GridSearchCV()
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf, parameters, scoring=scorer)

# Fit the grid search object to the training data and find the optimal parameters using fit()
grid_fit = grid_obj.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the estimator
best_clf = grid_fit.best_estimator_

# Make predictions using the unoptimized and model
predictions = (clf.fit(X_train, y_train)).predict(X_test)
best_predictions = best_clf.predict(X_test)

# Report the before-and-afterscores
print("Unoptimized model\n------")
print("Accuracy score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, predictions, beta = 0.5)))
print("\nOptimized Model\n------")
print("Final accuracy score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions)))
print("Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
```

    Unoptimized model
    ------
    Accuracy score on testing data: 0.8630
    F-score on testing data: 0.7395
    
    Optimized Model
    ------
    Final accuracy score on the testing data: 0.8692
    Final F-score on the testing data: 0.7476



```python
print("Best Parameters : ", grid_fit.best_params_)
```

    Best Parameters :  {'max_depth': 6, 'min_samples_leaf': 14, 'n_estimators': 100}



```python
import seaborn as sns

gridResults = grid_fit.grid_scores_
df_gridResults = pd.DataFrame([[r[0]['max_depth'], r[0]['min_samples_leaf'], r[1]] for r in gridResults], 
                              columns=['max_depth','min_samples_leaf','score'])

sns.heatmap(df_gridResults.pivot(columns='max_depth',index='min_samples_leaf', values='score'), annot=True)
```

### Question 5 - Final Model Evaluation

* What is the optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing data? 
* Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model? 
* How do the results from the optimized model compare to the naive predictor benchmarks we found earlier in **Question 1**?  

#### Results:

|     Metric     | Unoptimized Model | Optimized Model |
| :------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
| Accuracy Score |            0.8630 |          0.8692 |
| F-score        |            0.7395 |          0.7476 |


**Answer: **

The scores are slightly better than the unoptimized model and are much better than the naive predictor benchmarks.  The parameters of the optimized model are  6 for maximum depth and 14 for minimum samples leaf.

## Feature Importance

An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.

Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation
When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features are the most important for prediction, and in what order would be the rank and why?

**Answer:**

I think the rank from high to low for five important features are Occupation, Workclass, Education, Education-Num, and Native-Country. In most cases, people having good occupations and work classes earns more money than other people. People having higher education means they have higher chances to obtain a better occupation. Most immigrants are having good educations and skills, so they have abilities to immigrate to United States. 

### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance
Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.


```python
# Import a supervised learning model that has 'feature_importances_'
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# Train the supervised model on the training set using .fit(X_train, y_train)
model = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=random_state).fit(X_train, y_train)

# Extract the feature importances using .feature_importances_ 
importances = model.feature_importances_ 
```


```python
# Plot
def feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train):
    
    # Display the five most important features
    indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]
    columns = X_train.columns.values[indices[:5]]
    values = importances[indices][:5]

    # Creat the plot
    fig = pl.figure(figsize = (9,5))
    pl.title("Normalized Weights for First Five Most Predictive Features", fontsize = 16)
    pl.bar(np.arange(5), values, width = 0.6, align="center", color = '#00A000', \
          label = "Feature Weight")
    pl.bar(np.arange(5) - 0.3, np.cumsum(values), width = 0.2, align = "center", color = '#00A0A0', \
          label = "Cumulative Feature Weight")
    pl.xticks(np.arange(5), columns)
    pl.xlim((-0.5, 4.5))
    pl.ylabel("Weight", fontsize = 12)
    pl.xlabel("Feature", fontsize = 12)
    
    pl.legend(loc = 'upper center')
    pl.tight_layout()
    pl.show()  


feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train)
```


![png](Images/output_49_0.png)


### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance

Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \$50,000.  
* How do these five features compare to the five features discussed in **Question 6**?
* If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? 
* If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?

**Answer:**

Gradient boosting method gives five important features which are Education-Num, Age, Marital-Status, Capital-Loss, and Capital-Gain from rank high to low. The result is quite different from I thought except Education-Num. I guess Age feature reflects the capability to earn money after graduating and before retiring, so the model identifies people in a specific age range earn than 50 thousand. Capital-Loss and Capital-Gain features may have the relationships with Income feature. I am very surprised that married civilian spouse in Marital-Status feature is one of the important features.

### Feature Selection
How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model we found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 


```python
# Import functionality for cloning a model
from sklearn.base import clone

# Reduce the feature space
X_train_reduced = X_train[X_train.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]
X_test_reduced = X_test[X_test.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]

# Train on the "best" model found from grid search earlier
clf = (clone(best_clf)).fit(X_train_reduced, y_train)

# Make new predictions
reduced_predictions = clf.predict(X_test_reduced)

# Report scores from the final model using both versions of data
print("Final Model trained on full data\n------")
print("Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
print("\nFinal Model trained on reduced data\n------")
print("Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, reduced_predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, reduced_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
```

    Final Model trained on full data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8692
    F-score on testing data: 0.7476
    
    Final Model trained on reduced data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8584
    F-score on testing data: 0.7240


### Question 8 - Effects of Feature Selection

* How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?
* If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced data as your training set?

**Answer:**

The scores for fewer features' dataset are less than the full features' dataset which is only 3.15% difference of F-score. Therefore, I would suggest using the reduced data as the training set if the training time was a factor. It would be better to build models having less processing time and costs of computing.
